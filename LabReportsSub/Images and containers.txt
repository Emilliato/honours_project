Step 1 Customizing an image

Pulling, making changes and pushing your container to docker hub

#Pulling an image
docker run <image_name>

#running a container in the background
docker run -it -d <image_name>

#login to the container
docker exec -it <image_id> bash

----you can create a directory and many more

#Save changes and rename your container
docker commit <container_id> <user_name/new_image_name>

# run the container before you push it to your registry
docker push <image_name>
#error encountered (push failed, required me to login first)

# removing all images
 docker image prune -a
# removing all containers
  docker system prune
# -a removes both containers and images
