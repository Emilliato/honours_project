The Mars project has a database, and dependencies that need to be installed on a conda environment. 
To archive this we are going to use a docker image that have a conda environment installed already.
This saves time and helps in avoiding errors during conda installation.

A Dockerfile can be used to create an image and run all the commands for configuting an image or packaging a software.
